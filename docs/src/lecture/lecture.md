## Lecture Non-local structural mechanics and peridynamics

This lecture currently running as a cooperation between the [Magdeburg-Stendal University of applied sciences](www.h2.de) and the [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](www.ovgu.de)

In past decades non-local field theories were developed and utilized to capture complex phenomena such as damage and fracture. In this course, basic approaches to develop a non-local theory are introduced starting from elementary structures such as rod and beam and towards the three-dimensional solids. Examples of the analysis of engineering components undergoing damage processes will be presented. The learning competence is the development and use of powerful computational methods to evaluate the mechanical behavior of components.
